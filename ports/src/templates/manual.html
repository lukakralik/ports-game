            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">1. Admin Panel</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>Admin Panel</strong> is where you can initialize and manage the game. Here's what you can do:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>New Port</strong>: Create new ports with unique prices for goods like rice, tea, wine, spices, gold, diamonds, and cannons.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-4">2. Ports</h3>
            <p>
                Ports are the heart of the game. Each port has different prices for goods. Here's what you can do:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>View Port Details</strong>: Click on a port to see its prices and available goods.</li>
                <li><strong>Trade Goods</strong>: Buy or sell goods at ports to maximize your profits.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-4">3. Crews</h3>
            <p>
                Crews represent your trading team. Each crew has a limited carrying capacity and a starting balance. Here's what you can do:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Manage Crews</strong>: View your crew's inventory, balance, and carrying capacity.</li>
                <li><strong>Trade Goods</strong>: Use your crew to buy and sell goods at ports.</li>
                <li><strong>Become a Pirate</strong>: If your crew buys cannons, they become pirates and can steal from other crews.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-4">4. Pirates</h3>
            <p>
                Pirates can steal from other crews. Here's how it works:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Steal Funds</strong>: Pirates can attack other crews and steal a percentage of their balance.</li>
                <li><strong>Cannon Advantage</strong>: The crew with more cannons wins the battle. If both crews have the same number of cannons, the attack fails.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-4">5. Services</h3>
            <p>
                A multitude of services can be managed by the port operators.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Loans</strong>: Invidual crews can take out loans. The interest rate and amount limit is determined by the port operator. The loan can be reapaid in multiple transfers or at once.</li>
                <li><strong>Crew storage upgrade</strong>: For an amount determined by the port</li>
                <li><strong>Arbitrary transfers</strong>: The operator is allowed to perform any kind of fund transfer for visiting crews if he deems it appropriate. Free play is expected but not enforced.
            </ul>


            <h3 class="mt-4">6. Game Over</h3>
            <p>
                When the game timer ends, the game is over. A "Game Over" screen will appear, possible options are New Game and Results screen. The winner is determined by the crew with the highest balance and most valuable inventory.
